## Creating Your Site's Content

All content for your site should be stored in the `source` directory. When authoring your content, you have the choice to create files using several formats, including:

- [Laravel's Blade templating language](/docs/content-blade)
- [Markdown](/docs/content-markdown)
- Or a variety of [other file types](/docs/content-other-file-types)
