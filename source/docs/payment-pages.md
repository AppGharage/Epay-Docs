## Payment Pages
A **Payment Page** can represent anything you want to charge money for, including; a downloadable product, a private course, T-shirt etc. Before you create a payment page, let's see how it works.

### How it works
Not a developer? Don't own a website? No problem, payment pages are desinged just for you. It is easy to setup and start receiving funds. You can create as many pages as you wish. For a business with multiple products, you may choose to create a page for each product. All you need to do is to share the preview link or url of the payment page.

#### Example Product pages you can create
> **NB** These are not the only ways, you can use it.

* `Private online course` - If you offer a course online, you can create a page for your course and share the link with your students to pay you through.
* `Downloadable products` - Suppose you sell books which can be downloaded after been purchased, You can create a payment page and       embed in your download button.
* `Virtual` - This is one that doesnâ€™t require shipping. For example, a freelance. You only need a page.

### Create a page

* Login to your account, go to the navigation on your **dashboard** > **Payment Pages tab**.
* On the top right corner is a button named **Create New Page**; click on it to create your payment page.
* Now, **copy the link** provided you when you create the page and start sharing with whoever needs to pay you.
