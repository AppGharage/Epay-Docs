#### [Accept Payments](/docs/payments)
## Payment Pages

Using our very simple checkout designs, you get your funds. Before you create a payment page, let's see how it works.

### How it works
Payment pages are the pages you create to charge a customer. It is easy to setup and start receiving funds if you are not a developer or don't own a website. You can create as many pages as you wish. For a business with multiple products, you can create a page for each product. All you need to do is to share the preview link of those pages.

#### Example Product pages you can create
> **NB** These are not the only ways, you can use it.

* `Private online course` - If you offer a course online, you can create a page for your course and share the link with your students to pay you through.
* `Downloadable products` - Suppose you sell books which can be downloaded after been purchased, You can create a payment page and       embed in your download button.
* `Virtual` - This is one that doesnâ€™t require shipping. For example, a freelance. You only need a page.

### Create a page

* Login to your account, go to the navigation on your **dashboard** > **Payment Pages tab**.
* On the top right corner is a button named **Create New Page**; click on it to create your payment page.
* Now, **copy the link** provided you when you create the page and start sharing with whoever needs to pay you.
