## Deploying Your Site

Since Jigsaw sites are just static HTML and Javascript, they are simple and cheap to deploy and host.

### Using GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free service for hosting static sites offered by GitHub. To get started, first read through [the documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) to get an understanding of how the service works.

The approach we use at Tighten for deploying Jigsaw sites to GitHub pages looks like this:

1. Build your site for production

    ```
    $ npm run production
    ```

2. Commit the `build_production` folder to your repository

    ```
    $ git add build_production && git commit -m "Build for deploy"
    ```

3. Use `git subtree push` to push _just_ the `build_production` folder to your `gh-pages` branch

    ```
    $ git subtree push --prefix build_production origin gh-pages
    ```

> Check out the NPM script we use to deploy this site [here](https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw-site/blob/master/package.json#L12).

### Using Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a service that provides free static site hosting and continuous deployment that can be configured to play nice with any static site generator.

To deploy a site to Netlify, first create a `netlify.toml` file with the following configuration:

```toml
[build]

command = "npm run production"
publish = "build_production"
environment = { PHP_VERSION = "7.2" }
```

Push this file to your repository.

Then [connect your repository to the Netlify app](https://app.netlify.com/start) to setup continuous deployment.

You can skip the build and deploy settings because Netlify will read the `netlify.toml` file we created earlier.

### Using Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a very affordable service for hosting static assets. You might have used it in the past for hosting things like images, user uploads, or PDFs in your web applications.

What you might not have known is that Amazon S3 also has first class support for hosting static sites, like your Jigsaw projects.

To deploy a site to S3, first build your site for production:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/jigsaw build production
```

Then simply follow the steps in [Amazon's static site documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html) to deploy your `build_production` folder to your S3 bucket.

### Manually

If you have an existing server that you'd like to use to host your Jigsaw site, all you need to do is get the contents `build_production` into a public folder that's pointed at by the URL you'd like to use.

### Changing the Source and Destination Directories

Jigsaw will look for your source files in a `source` directory, and will output your files to a directory named `build_` followed by the environment you specified in the `build` command (`build_local` by default, or `build_staging`, `build_production`, etc.). You can, however, customize these locations by adding a `build` key to the array in `config.php`, and specifying your own source and/or destination paths.

> _config.php_

```
<?php

return [
    'build' => [
        'source' => 'src',
        'destination' => 'my_desination',
    ],
    ...
```

Source and destination paths are relative to your project root, i.e where your config.php file is located.

> _config.php_

```
<?php

return [
    'build' => [
        'destination' => '../build-one-level-up',
    ],
    ...
```

To include the environment name in your destination path, use the `{env}` token in your path name. `{env}` will be replaced by the environment specified when running the `build` command, and defaults to `local`.

> _config.php_

```
<?php

return [
    'build' => [
        'destination' => '../../{env}/public',
    ],
    ...
```

In this example, running `./vendor/bin/jigsaw build staging` would output your built files to staging/public, two levels up from your project root. Jigsaw will create any directories that do not already exist.

You can also assign different source and build paths for different environments by using multiple [environment-specific `config.php` files](/docs/environments/). Source and destination paths in `config.production.php`, for example, will get merged with any build paths that have been defined in `config.php` when running `./vendor/bin/jigsaw build production`.
