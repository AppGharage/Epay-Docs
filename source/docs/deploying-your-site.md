## Deploying Your Site

Since Jigsaw sites are just static HTML and Javascript, they are simple and cheap to deploy and host.

### Using GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free service for hosting static sites offered by GitHub. To get started, first read through [the documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) to get an understanding of how the service works.

The approach we use at Tighten Co. for deploying Jigsaw sites to GitHub pages looks like this:

1. Build your site for production
    
    ```
    $ gulp --production && jigsaw build production
    ```

2. Commit the `build_production` folder to your repository

    ```
    $ git add build_production && git commit -m "Build for deploy"
    ```

3. Use `git subtree push` to push _just_ the `build_production` folder to your `gh-pages` branch

    ```
    $ git subtree push --prefix build_production origin gh-pages
    ```

> Check out the NPM script we use to deploy this site [here](https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw-site/blob/master/package.json#L12).

### Using Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a very affordable service for hosting static assets. You might have used it in the past for hosting things like images, user uploads, or PDFs in your web applications.

What you might not have known is that Amazon S3 also has first class support for hosting static sites, like your Jigsaw projects.

To deploy a site to S3, first build your site for production:

```
$ jigsaw build production
```

Then simply follow the steps in [Amazon's static site documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html) to deploy your `build_production` folder to your S3 bucket.

### Manually

If you have an existing server that you'd like to use to host your Jigsaw site, all you need to do is get the contents `build_production` into a public folder that's pointed at by the URL you'd like to use.

We plan to add specific documentation for manually serving a Jigsaw site with nginx soon!
