## Environments

Often you might want to use different site variables in your development and production environments. For example, in production you might want to render your Google Analytics tracking snippet, but not include it in development so you don't skew your results.

Jigsaw makes this simple by allowing you to create additional `config.php` files for your different environments.

Say your base `config.php` file looks like this:

```php
<?php

return [
    'staging' => true,
    'company' => 'Tighten',
];
```

You can override the `staging` variable in your production environment by creating a new file called `config.production.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'staging' => false,
];
```

This file is _merged_ on top of `config.php`, so you only need to specify the variables that you are changing.

### Building files for a specific environment

To build files for a specific environment, just pass the environment name as an argument when running the `build` command:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/jigsaw build production
```

Alternatively, if you are [using Laravel Mix to compile your assets](../compiling-assets), you can run the `production` script found in `package.json`:

```
$ npm run production
```

This will generate your site into a new folder called `build_production`, leaving your `build_local` folder untouched.
